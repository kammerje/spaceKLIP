Installation and Dependencies
-----------------------------
The current release of spaceKLIP is not stable enough for a straightforward install with conda / pip. At this stage
it is recommended that you clone the git repository directory for installation:

::

	git clone https://github.com/kammerje/spaceKLIP.git

If you would like a specific branch:

::

	git clone https://github.com/kammerje/spaceKLIP.git@branch

From here, it is **highly** recommended that you create a unique anaconda environment to hold all of the spaceKLIP
dependencies. spaceKLIP is not currently compatible with python 3.12

::

	conda create -n spaceklip python=3.11
	conda activate spaceklip

With the anaconda environment created, move to the cloned directory and install most of the dependencies:

::

	cd where/you/installed/the/git/repo
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	pip install -e .

Finally, and very importantly, you will need to download reference files to support the functioning of the :code:`webbpsf` and :code:`webbpsf_ext`. Instructions to do this can be found at the respective package websites (`WebbPSF <https://webbpsf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#installing-the-required-data-files>`_, `webbpsf_ext <https://github.com/JarronL/webbpsf_ext>`_). Ensure that if you edit your .bashrc file that you reopen and close your terminal to fully apply the changes (:code:`source ~/.bashrc` or :code:`source ~/.zshrc` may also work)

spaceKLIP makes use of the JWST data reduction pipeline (:code:`jwst` package) and its dependencies, including the JWST Calibration Reference Data System (CRDS).You will need to set environment variables for CRDS. Instructions are available here in the JWST pipeline docs: https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/quickstart.html (Section 3). If you already have a working copy of the JWST data pipeline on your computer, then this is probably already taken care of.
